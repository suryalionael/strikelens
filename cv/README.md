# StrikeLens CV pipeline

Python package `strikelens_cv`. Turns fight video into tracks, keypoints, and
strike suggestions in the shared tag schema.

```bash
uv sync
uv run strikelens-cv --version
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest
```

Heavy dependencies are optional extras and are not installed by default:

| Extra | Installs | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `ingest` | OpenCV, PySceneDetect | `ingest/` |
| `detect` | Ultralytics YOLO (+ ByteTrack) | `track/` |
| `pose` | MediaPipe | `pose/` (v1 default, see ADR 0004) |
| `train` | PyTorch | `strikes/` |

Install one with `uv sync --extra ingest`.

RTMPose (the pose upgrade path) is not an extra. MMPose installs with OpenMMLab's
`mim` tool (`uv pip install openmim && mim install mmpose`), and one of its
dependencies cannot be built by uv. Do this only when ADR 0004 is revisited.

Subpackages:

- `ingest/`: frame extraction (FFmpeg) and cut detection.
- `track/`: fighter detection and tracking, two stable IDs, referee filter.
- `pose/`: keypoints per fighter.
- `strikes/`: training windows, strike candidate model, inference to tags.
- `overlay/`: render boxes, skeletons, and a strike timeline onto video.

Data paths point into `data/` and `models/` at the repo root. Both are gitignored.
